# Sorting_algorithms
Different Sorting Algorithms and their efficiencies are implemented

1. Insertion Sort works efficiently for smaller arrays. 
2. Merge sort works efficiently on larger arrays but considerably poor on smaller chunks.
3. Quick sort works really well on arrays with larger length.
4. Tim sort is a combination of Insertion and merge and is used as a built in sort method in Java.
